# Sample-Sales

For this analysis piece, I used the Sales Sample Dataset on Kaggle (uploaded by Gus Segura) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data 
The questions I addressed are:

* Which countries have the most sales?

* Which customers bought the most and their distribution of products in each year? 

* Which month has the most sales and quantity ordered? 

* Which deal size has the most sales?
